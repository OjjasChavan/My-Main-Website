    <h1>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT ?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
        The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
        Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
        In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java. <br> <br>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
        that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
        dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
